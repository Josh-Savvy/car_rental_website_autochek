## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

-   Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager), or Yarn (also a package manager).

## Configuration

### Database Setup

AutoMobile Car Rental uses a private api to fetch car listings--you can reach out to me privately if you need the api url and token.

### Environment Variables

1. Copy the .env.sample file in the project root:

<pre>
